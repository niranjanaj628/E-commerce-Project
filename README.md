Task 1:   
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights  
1. Perform EDA on the provided dataset.
2. Derive at least 5 business insights from the EDA.
  
  
Task 2:   
Lookalike Model  
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model should:
● Use both customer and product information.  
● Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer.  

Task 3:   
Customer Segmentation / Clustering  
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information (from Customers.csv) and transaction information (from Transactions.csv).  
● Calculate clustering metrics, including the DB Index(Evaluation will be done on this).  
● Visualise your clusters using relevant plots.
